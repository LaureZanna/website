The oceans are a major sink of heat and carbon, able to delay climate
change. The role of ocean heat uptake remains central in quantifying
both the magnitude and timescale of the local and global climate
response to forcing.

One main focus of our work is on the mechanisms of heat and carbon storage and transport, and on the quantification of
their feedbacks onto the atmosphere and global climate. One goal is to
understand the role of air-sea fluxes and of the large-scale ocean
circulation in setting the ocean and atmospheric CO2 levels.
