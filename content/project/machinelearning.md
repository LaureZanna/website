Big data is ubiquitious in many areas of science- we have recently
used a range of machine-learning algorihtms to tackle several problems
in climate such as forecasting using neural networks, or
parametrization using super-resolution imaging. Stay tuned for more
projects and details soon... or be in touch if you are interested in
collaborating with us.
