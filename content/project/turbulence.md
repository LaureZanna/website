Ocean mesoscale eddies strongly affect the strength and variability of
ocean jets such as the Gulf Stream. The spatial scales of eddies are
too small to be resolved in climate models and hence their effects on
the large-scale circulation need to be parametrized. The most common
parametrizations used in coarse-resolution models are not adequate for
the current generation of models, in which eddies are partially
resolved. Furthermore, eddies are turbulent and stochastic in nature
however current bulk parametrizations of mesoscale eddies are
deterministic and do not account for subgrid transport fluctuations or
upscale turbulent cascades therefore leading to model error in the
representation of present and future climate change. The group is
developing new parametrizations which specifically account for such
effects and for model error associated with the uncertainty in the
parametrizations. The parametrizations are constructed by using first
principles, statistical mechanics, and high-resolution model outputs.
