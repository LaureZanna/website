In addition to its role played in heat and carbon uptake, the
large-scale ocean circulation in the Atlantic is an important driver
of European climate variability on interannual and decadal
timescales. Yet, the importance of its influence remains unclear due
in part to the short historical record and the poor representation of
this variability in climate simulations. To explore the large
discrepancies between coupled general circulation models (GCMs) in
their representation of the meridional overturning circulation (MOC)
decadal variability and predictions in the Atlantic sector, we have
introduced new diagnostic and numerical tools.
