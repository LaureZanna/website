Climate projections are subject to three sources of uncertainties:
initial condition, model and scenario. Our research is concerned with
the first two kinds of errors. Specifically, how do the lack of ocean
observations, the chaotic nature of the climate system and the poor
representation of subgrid turbulent processes impact predictions on
intra-seasonal to centennial timescales. Being able to quantify the
predictability limits of the ocean is crucial for providing reliable
climate predictions. We use theory, observations and numerical
simulations to assess the uncertainties associated the ocean dynamics.
