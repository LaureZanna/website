We analyze in depth the dynamcal properties of a parametrization for ocean turbulence.
The parametrization is based on the deformation of the fluid parcel.
We show that the parametrization can help sharpen gradients, enhancing filamentation.
Glabally, the parametrization conserves energy and dissipates enstrophy.
