In ensemble prediction, it is crucial to quantify model uncertainty which is believed to be the dominant factor on seasonal to decadal timescales. 
Here, we quantify model uncertainty in the ocean component of a seasonal forecast system by introducing stochastic parametrization. We find that the stochastically perturbed parameterization tendency (SPPT) scheme provided the largest impact on the model spread and bias. We also suggest new ways to reduce forecast error.
