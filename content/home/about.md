# Biography

My research focuses on the dynamics of the climate system. The main
emphasis is to study the influence of the ocean on local and global
scales, through the analysis of observations and a hierarchy of
numerical simulations. Recently, I have worked on a wide range of
topics including ocean redistribution of heat under climate change,
regional sea level rise, air-sea coupling and predictability in
mid-latitudes, ocean turbulence in climate models.
